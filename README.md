# TeeShop Online Store

`Vite` and `React` were used to bootstrap this project, which includes integration with `Stripe`.

We fetch data with the [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/docs/getting-started) hook.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Run `npm` install to install the dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
4. Open <http://localhost:5173> in your browser to view the app.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

`npm run dev`

Runs the app in development mode with hot reloading.

Open <http://localhost:5173> to view it in the browser.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.

`npm run build`
`npm run preview`

Boots up a local static web server that serves the files from dist at <http://localhost:4173>. It's an easy way to check if the production build looks OK in your local environment.
